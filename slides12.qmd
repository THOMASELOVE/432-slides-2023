## Part of Bradley et al.'s Table 1

## A Data Set

The `bradley.csv` data set on our web site is simulated, but consists of 1,374 observations (687 Cases and 687 Controls) containing:

- a subject identification code, in `subject`
- `status` (case or control)
- age (in years)
- sex (Male or Female)
- race/ethnicity (white or non-white)
- married (1 = yes or 0 = no)
- location (ICU, bed, other)

The `bradley.csv` data closely match the summary statistics provided in Table 1 of the Bradley et al. article. Our job is to recreate that part of Table 1, as best as we can.

## The `bradley.csv` data (first 5 rows)

- The `bradley_sim.md` file on our web site shows you how I simulated the data.

## To "Live" Coding

On our web site (Data and Code + Class 12 materials)

- In the `data` folder:
    - `bradley.csv` data file
- `bradley_table1.Rmd` R Markdown script
- `bradley_table1.md` Results of running R Markdown
- `bradley_table1_result.csv` is the table generated by that R Markdown script

# To The "Live Code"

## Opening `bradley_table1_result.csv` in Excel

## Learning More About Table 1

Chapter 18 of the Course Notes covers two larger examples, and more details, like...

- specifying factors, and re-ordering them when necessary
- using non-normal summaries or exact categorical tests
- dealing with warning messages and with missing data
- producing Table 1 in R so you can cut and paste it into Excel or Word

FYI: Lab 05 (due 2023-03-06) requires you to build a Table 1 from data.

Good luck on the Quiz!
